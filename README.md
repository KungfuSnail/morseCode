A simple way to hide your secret message in plain sight.

Having a secret alphabet or a secret algorith to communicate is great, but just doing that will always attract the curious to try and decode your messages and find out what you are up to. Well how about hiding your secret message in plain sight? 

The way it works:
This program encodes a short hidden message in a normal-looking text file like an email. The program encodes the message by leaving spaces at the end of the lines of the text. The spaces are not visible unless you highlight the text, and even if you do it doesn't look very suspicious. Have a look at the lines below:

A) A simple line of text.


B) A simple line of text.

Both these lines looks the same when you are reading them, but if you select the text and look at it when it is highlighted you will see that A has two spaces at the end of it.
